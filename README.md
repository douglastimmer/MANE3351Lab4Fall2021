---

#### Learning Goals

1.  Utilize logical statements in Python
2.  Modify plots produced in Python library matplotlib.

#### Description

In Lab 4, you are to modify the Lab 4 Template Jupyter notebook. The Lab 4 Jupyter Notebook finds the probability that *Z < a* for the standard normal distribution and plots the pdf of the standard normal distribution indicating the area to be found.

The purpose of Lab 4 is to modify the template to solve *Z > b* and produce a plot of solving this problem. In addition, modify the settings of the plot so that all of color settings of the plot command are modified

#### Step 1

Modify the probability calculation and print statement to solve *P(Z > b)* and output the result for the standard normal distribution.

#### Step 2

Modify the plot statements to correctly display the area being found and change all of the color settings.

#### Step 3

After completing steps 1-2, remember to push your local repository back to Dr. Timmer's master repository.
